# scrum-poker-planner
Scrum poker planner client for android with my own library for mvvm-like architecture

Example project, that shows how to use library https://github.com/Grigory-Rylov/yet-another-mvvm-lib.
The Library helps forget about android view-life cycle and write program with mvvm-like approach.
Even if process was killed by system, after resore - your view and presenters holds ther last state, 
whithout manual storing state to Bundle (I tell you a secret: library do it automatic)
